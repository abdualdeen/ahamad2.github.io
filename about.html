      <h1>Welcome to My Class Project Website</h1>
      <h3>By Abdullah Hamad</h3>
      <p>
        This website is a project for my Internet Systems and Programming class
        (CSCE 464). The purpose of this project is to practically apply website
        creation concepts taught in class, including HTML and CSS.
      </p>
      <p>
        The website features a simple design and layout, with a focus on ease of
        use and accessibility. It includes a homepage, about page, and contact
        page, which can be navigated using the menu at the top of the page. The
        website also includes some basic JavaScript functionality, such as a
        contact form validation.
      </p>
      <p>
        Overall, this project has been a great learning experience and has
        allowed me to gain a better understanding of website creation and
        development. Thank you for visiting my website!
